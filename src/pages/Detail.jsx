        <h1>Taco Party</h1>
        <p>Josh Niernberg brought us in as creative partners to help bring his fast casual restaurant concept in Grand Junction, Colorado to life. He had a solid foundation for the restaurant—and a rad name—but it needed a visual identity. So we pulled inspiration from Taco Party’s modular approach to their menu, applied a desertscape motif, and got the party started.</p>
